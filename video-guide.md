# Video Guide

Spend time determining the objectives and outcomes of your video, then outline what you would like to cover in the video and map out the paths you will take the users on to accomplish your objectives and outcomes. Think about the context, what paths/datasets/tools are more common to the viewers.

Identify a meaningful title and description for your video. Think about the action the user is trying to take and the keywords they might use to find your video. You can use services like Google Trends to come up with meaningful titles and descriptions based on what users are searching for.

Make sure the viewer can see you at different intervals, for instance, the start of the video, midway through the video, and/or at the end of the video. Viewers can establish better trust by seeing the speaker.

Varying your voice such as using a different tone or via emphasis can help with keeping your viewers engaged. Be sure to outline where you might vary your tone in the video. Also, consider bringing in guest presenters. They can help with variation and bring additional context for the viewers.

Viewers respond to images vs text more positively. Too much text, beyond 75 words, your slide becomes more like a document. This can also happen with bullets and it is best to minimize the number of bullets on a slide. It is difficult to scan through a text heavy slide while following the presenter.

Think about the accessibility of your slides, especially the contrast between text, the slide background, images used, but also whether they are machine readable and available to search engines. Make sure viewers can access the slides used in the video, for instance, listing the slides in a YouTube description.

Keep the conversation going around the video by encouraging viewers to engage via social media or even polling. Also, make it apparent how the viewers can contact you/the organization by listing contact information on the first and last slide but also on all the slides if possible.

Create meaningful labels/tags for the video and make sure the video can be seen on the main BioData Catalyst YouTube account/channel.
